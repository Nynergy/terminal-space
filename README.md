# terminal-space

A terminal-based game about space, money, and hauling things across the known
universe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_terminal-space_ is meant to be a game about space-trucking, exploration,
trading, and trying not to get blown up somewhere out there in the vast
universe. It is heavily inspired by games like [Escape Velocity
Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_Nova), where the player is
given a small shuttle to explore charted space, make a profit through
interstellar trade, and perhaps get tangled up in a universe-spanning conflict
that threatens their life. Y'know, _fun_.

At the moment there isn't much to see. Come back when there's some actual
gameplay to be had. :)
